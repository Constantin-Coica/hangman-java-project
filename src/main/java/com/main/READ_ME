### HANGAMAN GAME PROJECT ###

The task of this project is to create a game based on hangman using the Java Basics (Class creation, method implementation and
the use of static).
The way the project was conceived was as such:
1. A WordManagement class that has static variables which is used to store the potential words for use guessing. This class' methods and variables
were made to be static because the class only holds data and gives it when necessary, instantiating would have no value.
2. A UserManagement class that uses a scanner to get the input from the user, validate it and return it.
3. A Display class that that prints out to the console different information that the user must know (rules, current lives they have, letters guesseed,
the hangman drawing). Each method takes different information that's going to be used when making the String to display.
4. The Hangman class which brings everything together in order to create the functionality for the game itself.

Extra:
*ArrayLists and HashMaps implement the List, Map interfaces respectively. There are multiple benefits for declaring them like this (they are quicker
    when it comes to manipulating objects and can be reworked easily to different types of lists such as LinkedList in the event that that is needed).
    For more information on the difference between the two declarations: https://www.javatpoint.com/list-vs-arraylist-in-java#:~:text=The%20List%20is%20an%20interface%2C%20and%20the%20ArrayList%20is%20a,expand%20the%20array%20when%20needed
*The loop to play again was done in the Main class as that will make it more reusable than having it run multiple times by default.
*Proper encapsulation was done for the majority of the project.
